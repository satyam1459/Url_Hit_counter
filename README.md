>### Framework Used 
* [SpringBoot](javatpoint.com/spring-boot-tutorial)

>### Language Used
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html)
>## Data flow
In this project, we have two layers-
* **Controller** - The controller layer handles the HTTP requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business (service) layer. In short, it consists of views i.e., frontend part.
* **Service** -The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers.

>## Data Structure used in my project
This document outlines the steps to create a simple URL hit counter feature using Spring Boot. The feature will track the number of hits for a given URL or a URL associated with a specific username.

>Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project

* Use the Spring Initializer tool to create a new Spring Boot project.
* Select Maven as the project type.
* Choose the desired Java version and packaging type.
* Add the "Spring Web"
and "SpringBoot dev Tools" dependency to the project.
* Click on the "Generate" or "Generate and download" button to download the project files.

>Step 2: Create the UrlHitController Class

* Create a new Java class called UrlHitController in the controller package of your Spring Boot project.
* Annotate the class with @RestController and @RequestMapping("api/v1/visitor-count-app").
* Autowire an instance of the UrlHitService class, which will be used to handle the business logic.
* Add a @GetMapping method to handle the URL hit count endpoint. Use the URL path "count".
* Inside the method, call the getHitCount() method of the UrlHitService class to get the hit count.
* You can print the hit count to the console or return it as a response to the client.

>Step 3: Create the UrlHitService Class
* Create a new Java class called UrlHitService in the service package of your Spring Boot project.
* Annotate the class with @Service to indicate that it's a service class.
* Add a private integer field to keep track of the hit count.
* Implement a getHitCount() method  and getHitCount (String username) that returns the current hit count and HashMap as response respectively.
* You can customize the business logic for updating and retrieving the hit count based on your requirements. For example, you can use a database or an external cache to store and retrieve the hit count.
>## Project Summary

The above project implements a simple URL hit counter feature using Spring Boot. It consists of a UrlHitController class that handles the URL hit count endpoint and calls the UrlHitService class to handle the business logic. The UrlHitService class maintains a hit count and provides methods to update and retrieve the hit count. The application can be tested locally by running the Spring Boot application and accessing the hit count endpoint. The implementation can be customized further based on requirements, such as associating hit counts with specific usernames.
